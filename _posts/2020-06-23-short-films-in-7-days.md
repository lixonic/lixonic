A visual metaphor is the representation of a person, place, thing, or idea by means of a visual image that suggests a particular association or point of similarity. It's also known as pictorial metaphor and analogical juxtaposition.

Its Lockdown 2.0 and i decided to make some shortfilms using metaphors and i still doubt how convincing these videos are! Stock videos/music are taken from envato elements.

## 1. Revival

Mostly sci-fi stuff. The flatline beeps indicates the heart stopped, [but the brain is still alive at the moment][sciencealert]. The memories are instantly uploaded to a super computer which process the data and creates a virtual identity of the person. Using cutting edge tech! scientists are able to 3D print the replica of the brain and feeds the processed data so that it acquires consciousness. 

The Water/Beverage into glass is a visual metaphor used to describe the processes of re-Connection or Revival.

## 2. Extraction

Extraction is an action of extracting something, especially using effort or force. The 3 commandos are trying to rescue a hostage. The main character so stressed and the movie ends as he picks himself up and continue his mission.

From another point of view the boy in chains depicts the soldier’s mind itself.  He has post traumatic stress and feels low as his past failures haunts him. At that time he tries to master the fear of failure by remembering the experience as a firefighter where a girl is rescued successfully.
Also his mission status is left to the viewers imagination.

## 3. Mystic Forest

As humans we always fear the unknown, and sometimes we fantasize about a deity/demon that haunts us even when we know its unreal; mainly because of our primitive brain. Here the female character is fantasizing her fear  while walking through the woods. The initial scene shows the fog and full moon which are unavoidable elements for a horror genre.  

A mystic/shaman is conjuring a spirit/demon from the forest.  From the dress code and the drum used by the shaman , it is clear that his ethnicity is red-indian and the female is a Caucasian  descendant.

## 4. A Writer's Dilemma

The battle between the creative angel and the devilish editor. Here the female character is depicted as the writer’s figment of imagination. As a writer (creative writer implied by his desk), he struggle to find focus. Suddenly he has an interesting insight and starts typing in a flow.  A pleasant female character in the meadow depicts his imagination/mind. Later when he tries to edit his own work, he destroys his original ideas which is depicted by the dark dressed female.

## 5. A journey lost in time

The male character starts his journey, walking by a railroad. The screen displays a monochrome visual for stating his journey already started in the past.  The steam engine also depicts the past. 

The next part shows a female waiting for her loved one (brother, friend, lover). She holds yellow flowers which symbolizes joy, bonds of friendship, the taste of success and pride. It also shows and underlines the presence of electrified railroads and a metaphor ( light at the end of the tunnel). The female is shown a bit hopeless compared to earlier in next part, which implies he couldn’t made it in ‘time’ or he is not coming. The latter of the story is left to the viewers.

Both characters are from different timelines. Longing to be with a loved one is same irrespective of their timelines.
