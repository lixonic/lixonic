The bottle and the message in it are personified in this video. It's starts the journey with high expectations and desires. The shape and texture of both items transforms from 0:17 - 1:00,  which represents peer pressure, unpredictable life events etc. It still hopes that the value it holds will transpire someday. The final part is optimistic, but its left to viewers imagination.
