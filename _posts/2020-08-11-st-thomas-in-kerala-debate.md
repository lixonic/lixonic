#### Topic: According to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 which is in present-day Pattanam, Kerala.


## For

1. The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then. The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa. 

2. A number of 3rd and 4th century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian

3. The tradition of origin of the Christians in Kerala is found in a version of the Songs of Thomas or Thomma Parvam, written in 1601 and believed to be a summary of a larger and older work. Thomas is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding 7 Churches, or Ezharapallikal.




## Against

1. According to legend, the St.Thomas began with conversion of Brahmin families in 1st CE (AD 52 -  72). But brahmins came as a hegemonic group only after 8th CE (AD 700 - 900)

2. There are historical records which suggest presence of brahmins, specifically <b>Namboothiris</b> in 1st CE (Sangam period). But they were Buddhist monks not Hindu brahmins who helped Chera kings in administration. Thus the legend of st thomas performing miracle before <b> Namboothiris</b> Brahmins at Paloor is also debatable.

3. The earliest reference to St. Thomas preaching gospel to Brahmins is from St. Jerome of 4th century <b> (AD 300 -)</b>  who mentions that the apostle went “ut Christus apud Brachmanas praedicaret” (to preach Christ to the Brahmins).  As well as the Gospel of Thomas (Compiled between AD 200 - 300)  states that thomas visited south india in his second mission; [ is considered as Fraud ](https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/554-is-the-gospel-of-thomas-real-or-fake).

4. According to the New Testament, the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a house church (domus ecclesiae), the Dura-Europos church, founded between AD 233 and 256. So founding 7 Churches in 1st CE is debatable.

5. Same as [4] the shape of the cross (crux, stauros "stake, gibbet"), as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a "seal" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century. And the Latin cross which is erected at the famous Malayattoor by thomas (AD 52 -) only became one of the signs of christianity after conversion of Emperor Constantine I and his Edict of Milan legalizing Christian worship (AD 313 -). 


## Inferences

1. The Christian community in South India was founded by a merchant called Knai Thoma or Thomas of Cana in 345 AD—a name which readily explains the Thomas legend. He led four hundred refugees who fled persecution in Persia and were given asylum by the Hindu authorities.
