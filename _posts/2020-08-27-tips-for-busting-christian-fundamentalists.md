### Some background

<!-- I was a pious catholic till the age for 23, solely because of childhood indoctrination and poor quality of life. Later when I started living life on my own terms, transformation happened from a thiest to deist and then to an apatheist. And I find no difference between an athiest and a theist just because both are extreme on arguing about a supreme god which is highly irrelevant in terms of the objective nature of human existence.   -->

I know for a fact that religion was an ingenious solution to many of mankind's earliest fears and needs.
Religion has its origins in a desire to explain a very confusing world. It is a wild projection onto the natural realm of all kinds of human concerns. And many of those stories are made implausible by science.

The Christian church has often been a patron of sciences, though it did some horrific deeds in the past. Pontifical academy of sciences is a great example to prove that the church has already scrapped stories and the concept of GOD which fundamentalists hold dear. 


<blockquote>
 The Bible is not a science textbook. When it was written, the idea of “science textbooks” didn’t even exist. And to confuse it with a science book does the Bible no honor. Great works of literature, philosophy, or theology are studied as intently today as when they were written, but no scientist actually learns science today from reading, say, Newton’s original works. Science books go out of date only a few years after they are written and must be constantly revised. By contrast, the Bible is timeless. Thus, you can see that the Bible is fundamentally different from a science book ~ vaticanobservatory
</blockquote>
One could argue that it is utterly nonsensical to reason with religious fundamentalists, but at some point only rational thoughts will help these people to alleviate the agony caused by religious dogmatism and moral absolutism. 

<!-- I started my spiritual quest as theist (solely because of childhood indoctrination) to diest and then to an apatheist. You may wonder why not atheist. Specially atheism and theism are two sides of the same coin in my opinion, just because both cannot agree to a point that the existence of GOD doesn't matter in terms of the objective reality of human life. An apathiest on the other hand will be like, if there is a GOD - good! ,and if there isn't - very good! -->

<b>I'm not claiming that the arguments and facts given below are infallible</b>, but it's enough to taunt those pious and deluded fundamentalist fools who mock to be the men of god and preach their dogma in times of existential crisis. Obviously, their answers will be filled with fallacies and vivid imagination, but it's worth a try when they confront you with their stupidity.


<!-- These tips are not meant for those who value (christian) culture and its contribution to science & society, but for those pious and deluded fools who mocks church and cherry pick verses. Obviously those self fooling morons can answer each question using their vivid imagination and fallacies. -->

## Appetizer

<strong>1.   If bible is the true word of God and is infallible why can't you believe that the earth is flat? </strong>

<blockquote>God of bible created heaven & earth first and then the sun and other celestial objects later. This supports geocentric version of universe where the earth is believed to be flat. 
</blockquote>

<strong> 2. If God created humans as a man and woman, where does the other genders (LGBTQ) comes from?</strong>

<strong> 3. If God created humans in his own image, then this would suggest that God too had a navel which in turn would suggest that God had parents... did God have parents? Did Adam and Eve have parents? </strong>


<blockquote>If, as fundamentalists would have us believe, God created all living things as they are now, of course Adam and Eve had navels. However, if that is what He did, why did He give Adam, and all male mammals, nipples? It seems a pointless provision ~ Mike Bird, Maryport, Cumbria </blockquote>


<strong>4. How did penguins and kangaroos get on Noah’s Ark? If both animals weren't there, can you agree that Noah's god didn't knew about the continents of Australia and Antartica. Also if they were present in the Ark, how can explain the lack of fossil evidence in the MiddleEast?</strong>

<blockquote>
The story of Noah may be part of the Abrahamic canon, but the legend of the Great Flood almost certainly has prebiblical origins, rooted in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh dates back nearly 5,000 years and is thought to be perhaps the oldest written tale on the planet. In it, there is an account of the great sage Utnapishtim, who is warned of an imminent flood to be unleashed by wrathful gods. He builds a vast circular-shaped boat, reinforced with tar and pitch, that carries his relatives, grains and animals
</blockquote>

<strong>5. Why in your opinion that GOD decided to destroy all animals on earth as punishment for the crimes of Humans? (Genesis 6:7)</strong>
<blockquote>
The Bible thinks it is perfectly all right to destroy all animals as punishment for the
crimes of Homo sapiens, as if the existence of giraffes, pelicans and ladybirds has lost all purpose if
humans misbehave. The Bible could not imagine a scenario in which God repents having created
Homo sapiens, wipes this sinful ape off the face of the earth, and then spends eternity enjoying the
antics of ostriches, kangaroos and panda bears ~ homo deus</blockquote>

## Salad

<strong>1. The story of Moses mother hiding her infant son in a basket of rushes caulked with pitch, and entrusting him to the river, is also adapted from an older Middle Eastern story.</strong>
<blockquote>
The original river was the Euphrates, the role of Pharaoh's daughter was played by the goddess Ishtar, and the child grew up to be the Mesopotamian king, Sargon of Akkad. In ancient times rivers were thought of as the embodiment of gods, so in the original tale the mother was entrusting her child to a deity, not abandoning him to the elements. The story of Moses, which may be found in Exodus 2:1-10, dates from about 1,000 years after that of Sargon.
</blockquote>

<strong>2. God giving Moses tablets of stone on which were inscribed God's commandments is also copied from Hammurabi receiving his tablets on top of a ziggurat from Babylonian Sun god Shamash</strong>
 
<blockquote>
The laws given to Hammurabi are sophisticated, exceeding 280 in number. They evidently provided the basis not only for the story of divine laws being inscribed on tablets, but also for some of the later Jewish laws. To take an example, the Code of Hammurabi states that:

If a man shall put out the eye of another, then let his own eye be put out. If a man shall knock out the teeth of another ... then let his own teeth be knocked out

The familiar Mosaic Code (Exodus 21:23-24) is more concise:

...thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth
</blockquote>

<strong>3. The story of the Tower of Babel echoes that of the Giant's staircase to Olympus. Samson slaying the lion echoes Hercules slaying the Nemean lion (and also has an older parallel in the saga of Gilgamesh ). Again, in Genesis (22:1-13) God tests Abraham by telling him to kill his son Isaac and offer him up as a burnt offering. At the last minute God settles for the sacrifice of a ram instead. This is an adaptation of another old Sumerian legend, tailored to demonstrate God's mercy and benevolence. It also has a classical parallel. When Agamemnon was about to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia, the goddess Diana, struck by compassion, substituted a goat at the last minute. </strong>

##  Main course
<strong>1. Please try to explain why Matthew and Luke authors give conflicting versions of Jesus' ancestry (Matthew 1:1-16 and Luke 3:23-38). </strong>
<blockquote>
According to the Luke gospel, Jesus had 41 ancestors since David, according to the Matthew gospel only 26. Nearly all the names in the two lists are different. Even the name of Jesus' paternal grandfather is different. According to Matthew he was called Jacob, while according to Luke he was called Heli.
</blockquote>
<strong>2. Nativity stories in the two gospels (Matthew and Luke) bear virtually no resemblance to each other, and contradict each other on a number of points!</strong>

<blockquote>
 According to Luke, Jesus' family had to travel to Bethlehem for a tax census that took place when Quirinius or Cyrenius was governor of Syria (Luke 2:1-3). This census is stated to have been the first during his governorship (Luke 2:2). Such a census is an historical reality and is known to have been carried out in AD 6 or 7. Furthermore, we may accept that the census was carried out for taxation purposes, since the Romans carried out such censuses for taxation and conscription, and the Jews were exempt from military service30. But now the problems start. Luke says that the census was the result of a decree from Caesar Augustus to the whole world, but this must be an error. The real census affected Roman Judea only. Galilee was not part of Roman Judæa, so Joseph, a Galilaean, would not have been affected. Even if he had been affected, he would not have had to travel to another town. Like the tax it was related to, the census was based on property, so people registered where they lived. The Romans did not care about genealogies, and neither did they require mass migrations. Furthermore, such taxes would have required only Joseph to register — even if a census had been carried out in Nazareth, Mary would not have been required to stir herself, heavily pregnant or not. Luke's story does not hold water. Worse, it cannot be squared with that of Matthew. Matthew does not mention the census at all. According to him Jesus was born before the death of Herod. The only possible Herod is Herod I (Herod the Great) and he died in 4 BC. Thus there is a discrepancy of some ten years between the two stories.
 </blockquote>
<strong>3. Jesus gave contradictory instructions to apostles according to the gospels. According to Mark 6:8 they were told to take a staff, but according to Matthew 10:10 they were instructed not to take a staff.</strong>

<strong> 4. When jesus raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead, did he die again or lived forever afterwards? (John 11:38-44)</strong>
## Dessert
<strong> 1. Incorruptibility of Catholic Saints. Latest victim is Carlo Acutis whose body appeared to be preserved from the natural process of decay after his death in 2006</strong>
 <blockquote>  Incorruptibility is the idea that if you're holy enough your body won't rot away after death and you may be a saint. It's one of many bizarre ideas in the doctrinal body of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, although similar ideas can be found in other religions</blockquote>
Bishop Domenico Sorrentino of Assisi clarified Oct. 1 that Carlo’s body (pictured), though intact, “was found in the normal state of transformation typical of the cadaveric condition.” Carlo’s body was arranged with dignity for its display for public veneration and a <strong> silicone reconstruction of his face </strong> used, he said.
