### The Divine Fallacy - Argument From Incredulity

<em>Example – “Of course God created the Universe, I don’t see how it’s possible for it to come from nothing.” </em>
 
A person using this fallacy attempts to use their inability to understand the scientific explanation for a certain phenomenon as proof that their alternative theory must be the right one.
<blockquote>
Claim: if I don’t know how to explain a certain phenomenon using science, then it must occur as a result of some divine intervention.
</blockquote>

 

### Appeal to Ignorance

<em> Example – “You didn’t even know about (insert piece of scripture). See, I’m right, our (Holy scripture) promotes Love and Peace, not violence.”</em>
 
Appeal to ignorance happens when one individual utilizes another individual’s lack of information on a specific subject as proof that his or her own particular argument is right.

<blockquote>
Person A : I don't believe in creationism.
</blockquote>

<blockquote> Person B: So, what happened before the Big Bang? Your science doesn't exist before then!   </blockquote>

<blockquote>Person A : Do you have a better alternative explanation ?

</blockquote>

<blockquote> Person B: Yes! its written clearly in scriptures and you don't even know it!   </blockquote>

### Ad Hominem
This is an often misused accusation. This fallacy is when someone uses an insult to discredit your argument. it is NOT just insulting someone.

<blockquote>
Person A : I don't believe in creationism. Evalution (miss spelled) has been completely proved to be true.
</blockquote>

<blockquote> Person B: You can’t even spell evolution, of course you’re wrong about it, you’re an idiot!   </blockquote>

### Ad Populum - Appeal to majority
<em>Example – “There are billions of Christians in the world, the wouldn’t all believe it if it wasn’t true.” </em>

This sort of appeal is when somebody asserts that a thought or conviction is correct since it is the thing that the general population accept.

### Circular Reasoning 
<em>Example – “The Bible is the ultimate source of truth. It says so in the Bible, and the Bible is the ultimate source of truth, so it must be true.”</em>

 This fallacy is also known as “Circulus in Probando”. This error is committed when an argument takes its evidence from an element inside the argument itself instead of from an outside one.


### Cherry Picking
<em>Example – “The Bible is about peace and love. Jesus says Love thy neighbour.” </em>

 This is when only specific parts of a source (The Bible, for example) are paid attention to. This is usually done due to liking what some parts say, but not others. It can also be used to understand how different denominations of the same religion believe in different things. As they naturally pick out the parts which gel with who they already are as a person.

### Anecdotal Evidence
<em> Example – “I know that Jesus is real because I had a spiritual experience and heard him speak to me.” </em>

 This, while not exactly being a fallacy as such, is still a flawed argument. It is stating that a personal story counts as proof. Even when there is no other data to support it, or when it can be explained by other phenomena.

### Slippery Slope

<em> Example – “If we let gay people get married, we’ll be allowing people to marry their pets in no time!”</em>

 The error happens when one contends that an exceptionally minor movement will unavoidably prompt great and frequently ludicrous conclusions.
